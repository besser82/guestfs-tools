To learn how to compile guestfs-tools from sources:

  guestfs-building(1)  or  http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-building.1.html

To learn how to extend guestfs-tools:

  guestfs-hacking(1)       http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-hacking.1.html

Although the above documentation applies specifically to libguestfs,
this project was split from that repo, and similar steps and principles
apply.

For example, replace libguestfs with guestfs-tools in commands like:

    dnf builddep guestfs-tools
